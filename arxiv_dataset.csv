State of the Art in Dense Monocular Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction,"3D reconstruction of deformable (or non-rigid) scenes from a set of monocular 2D image observations is a long-standing and actively researched area of computer vision and graphics. It is an ill-posed inverse problem, since--without additional prior assumptions--it permits infinitely many solutions leading to accurate projection to the input 2D images. Non-rigid reconstruction is a foundational building block for downstream applications like robotics, AR/VR, or visual content creation. The key advantage of using monocular cameras is their omnipresence and availability to the end users as well as their ease of use compared to more sophisticated camera set-ups such as stereo or multi-view systems. This survey focuses on state-of-the-art methods for dense non-rigid 3D reconstruction of various deformable objects and composite scenes from monocular videos or sets of monocular views. It reviews the fundamentals of 3D reconstruction and deformation modeling from 2D image observations. We then start from general methods--that handle arbitrary scenes and make only a few prior assumptions--and proceed towards techniques making stronger assumptions about the observed objects and types of deformations (e.g. human faces, bodies, hands, and animals). A significant part of this STAR is also devoted to classification and a high-level comparison of the methods, as well as an overview of the datasets for training and evaluation of the discussed techniques. We conclude by discussing open challenges in the field and the social aspects associated with the usage of the reviewed methods.",3D reconstruction of deformable (or non-rigid) scenes from a set of monocular 2D image observations is a long-standing and actively researched area of computer vision and graphics.
Deep Generative Models on 3D Representations: A Survey,"Generative models, as an important family of statistical modeling, target learning the observed data distribution via generating new instances. Along with the rise of neural networks, deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial network (GANs), have made tremendous progress in 2D image synthesis. Recently, researchers switch their attentions from the 2D space to the 3D space considering that 3D data better aligns with our physical world and hence enjoys great potential in practice. However, unlike a 2D image, which owns an efficient representation (i.e., pixel grid) by nature, representing 3D data could face far more challenges. Concretely, we would expect an ideal 3D representation to be capable enough to model shapes and appearances in details, and to be highly efficient so as to model high-resolution data with fast speed and low memory cost. However, existing 3D representations, such as point clouds, meshes, and recent neural fields, usually fail to meet the above requirements simultaneously. In this survey, we make a thorough review of the development of 3D generation, including 3D shape generation and 3D-aware image synthesis, from the perspectives of both algorithms and more importantly representations. We hope that our discussion could help the community track the evolution of this field and further spark some innovative ideas to advance this challenging task.","Generative models, as an important family of statistical modeling, target learning the observed data distribution via generating new instances.we make a thorough review of the development of 3D generation, including 3D shape generation and 3D-aware image synthesis, from the perspectives of both algorithms and more importantly representations"
Revisiting the ACVI Method for Constrained Variational Inequalities,"ACVI is a recently proposed first-order method for solving variational inequalities (VIs) with general constraints. Yang et al. (2022) showed that the gap function of the last iterate decreases at a rate of (1K√) when the operator is L-Lipschitz, monotone, and at least one constraint is active. In this work, we show that the same guarantee holds when only assuming that the operator is monotone. To our knowledge, this is the first analytically derived last-iterate convergence rate for general monotone VIs, and overall the only one that does not rely on the assumption that the operator is L-Lipschitz. Furthermore, when the sub-problems of ACVI are solved approximately, we show that by using a standard warm-start technique the convergence rate stays the same, provided that the errors decrease at appropriate rates. We further provide empirical analyses and insights on its implementation for the latter case","ACVI is a recently proposed first-order method for solving variational inequalities (VIs) with general constraints.Yang et al.

All the Feels: A dexterous hand with large area sensing,"High cost and lack of reliability has precluded the widespread adoption of dexterous hands in robotics. Furthermore, the lack of a viable tactile sensor capable of sensing over the entire area of the hand impedes the rich, low-level feedback that would improve learning of dexterous manipulation skills. This paper introduces an inexpensive, modular, robust, and scalable platform - the DManus- aimed at resolving these challenges while satisfying the large-scale data collection capabilities demanded by deep robot learning paradigms. Studies on human manipulation point to the criticality of low-level tactile feedback in performing everyday dexterous tasks. The DManus comes with ReSkin sensing on the entire surface of the palm as well as the fingertips. We demonstrate effectiveness of the fully integrated system in a tactile aware task - bin picking and sorting. Code, documentation, design files, detailed assembly instructions, trained models, task videos, and all supplementary materials required to recreate the setup can be found on this http URL","High cost and lack of reliability has precluded the widespread adoption of dexterous hands in robotics.This paper introduces an inexpensive, modular, robust, and scalable platform - the DManus- aimed at resolving these challenges while satisfying the large-scale data collection capabilities demanded by deep robot learning paradigms"
Learning to predict arbitrary quantum processes,"We present an efficient machine learning (ML) algorithm for predicting any unknown quantum process  over n qubits. For a wide range of distributions  on arbitrary n-qubit states, we show that this ML algorithm can learn to predict any local property of the output from the unknown process , with a small average error over input states drawn from . The ML algorithm is computationally efficient even when the unknown process is a quantum circuit with exponentially many gates. Our algorithm combines efficient procedures for learning properties of an unknown state and for learning a low-degree approximation to an unknown observable. The analysis hinges on proving new norm inequalities, including a quantum analogue of the classical Bohnenblust-Hille inequality, which we derive by giving an improved algorithm for optimizing local Hamiltonians. Overall, our results highlight the potential for ML models to predict the output of complex quantum dynamics much faster than the time needed to run the process itself.","We present an efficient machine learning (ML) algorithm for predicting any unknown quantum process  over n qubits.

ReFactor GNNs: Revisiting Factorisation-based Models from a Message-Passing Perspective,"Factorisation-based Models (FMs), such as DistMult, have enjoyed enduring success for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) tasks, often outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, unlike GNNs, FMs struggle to incorporate node features and generalise to unseen nodes in inductive settings. Our work bridges the gap between FMs and GNNs by proposing ReFactor GNNs. This new architecture draws upon both modelling paradigms, which previously were largely thought of as disjoint. Concretely, using a message-passing formalism, we show how FMs can be cast as GNNs by reformulating the gradient descent procedure as message-passing operations, which forms the basis of our ReFactor GNNs. Across a multitude of well-established KGC benchmarks, our ReFactor GNNs achieve comparable transductive performance to FMs, and state-of-the-art inductive performance while using an order of magnitude fewer parameters.","Factorisation-based Models (FMs), such as DistMult, have enjoyed enduring success for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) tasks, often outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

Learning Single-Index Models with Shallow Neural Networks,"Single-index models are a class of functions given by an unknown univariate ``link'' function applied to an unknown one-dimensional projection of the input. These models are particularly relevant in high dimension, when the data might present low-dimensional structure that learning algorithms should adapt to. While several statistical aspects of this model, such as the sample complexity of recovering the relevant (one-dimensional) subspace, are well-understood, they rely on tailored algorithms that exploit the specific structure of the target function. In this work, we introduce a natural class of shallow neural networks and study its ability to learn single-index models via gradient flow. More precisely, we consider shallow networks in which biases of the neurons are frozen at random initialization. We show that the corresponding optimization landscape is benign, which in turn leads to generalization guarantees that match the near-optimal sample complexity of dedicated semi-parametric methods.","Single-index models are a class of functions given by an unknown univariate ``link'' function applied to an unknown one-dimensional projection of the input.we introduce a natural class of shallow neural networks and study its ability to learn single-index models via gradient flow.

On the Importance and Applicability of Pre-Training for Federated Learning,"Pre-training is prevalent in nowadays deep learning to improve the learned model's performance. However, in the literature on federated learning (FL), neural networks are mostly initialized with random weights. These attract our interest in conducting a systematic study to explore pre-training for FL. Across multiple visual recognition benchmarks, we found that pre-training can not only improve FL, but also close its accuracy gap to the counterpart centralized learning, especially in the challenging cases of non-IID clients' data. To make our findings applicable to situations where pre-trained models are not directly available, we explore pre-training with synthetic data or even with clients' data in a decentralized manner, and found that they can already improve FL notably. Interesting, many of the techniques we explore are complementary to each other to further boost the performance, and we view this as a critical result toward scaling up deep FL for real-world applications. We conclude our paper with an attempt to understand the effect of pre-training on FL. We found that pre-training enables the learned global models under different clients' data conditions to converge to the same loss basin, and makes global aggregation in FL more stable. Nevertheless, pre-training seems to not alleviate local model drifting, a fundamental problem in FL under non-IID data.","Pre-training is prevalent in nowadays deep learning to improve the learned model's performance.

When to Make Exceptions: Exploring Language Models as Accounts of Human Moral Judgment,"AI systems are becoming increasingly intertwined with human life. In order to effectively collaborate with humans and ensure safety, AI systems need to be able to understand, interpret and predict human moral judgments and decisions. Human moral judgments are often guided by rules, but not always. A central challenge for AI safety is capturing the flexibility of the human moral mind -- the ability to determine when a rule should be broken, especially in novel or unusual situations. In this paper, we present a novel challenge set consisting of rule-breaking question answering (RBQA) of cases that involve potentially permissible rule-breaking -- inspired by recent moral psychology studies. Using a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) as a basis, we propose a novel moral chain of thought (MORALCOT) prompting strategy that combines the strengths of LLMs with theories of moral reasoning developed in cognitive science to predict human moral judgments. MORALCOT outperforms seven existing LLMs by 6.2% F1, suggesting that modeling human reasoning might be necessary to capture the flexibility of the human moral mind. We also conduct a detailed error analysis to suggest directions for future work to improve AI safety using RBQA. Our data is open-sourced at this https URL  and code at this https URL","AI systems need to be able to understand, interpret and predict human moral judgments and decisions.

LyricJam Sonic: A Generative System for Real-Time Composition and Musical Improvisation,"Electronic music artists and sound designers have unique workflow practices that necessitate specialized approaches for developing music information retrieval and creativity support tools. Furthermore, electronic music instruments, such as modular synthesizers, have near-infinite possibilities for sound creation and can be combined to create unique and complex audio paths. The process of discovering interesting sounds is often serendipitous and impossible to replicate. For this reason, many musicians in electronic genres record audio output at all times while they work in the studio. Subsequently, it is difficult for artists to rediscover audio segments that might be suitable for use in their compositions from thousands of hours of recordings. In this paper, we describe LyricJam Sonic -- a novel creative tool for musicians to rediscover their previous recordings, re-contextualize them with other recordings, and create original live music compositions in real-time. A bi-modal AI-driven approach uses generated lyric lines to find matching audio clips from the artist's past studio recordings, and uses them to generate new lyric lines, which in turn are used to find other clips, thus creating a continuous and evolving stream of music and lyrics. The intent is to keep the artists in a state of creative flow conducive to music creation rather than taking them into an analytical/critical state of deliberately searching for past audio segments. The system can run in either a fully autonomous mode without user input, or in a live performance mode, where the artist plays live music, while the system ""listens"" and creates a continuous stream of music and lyrics in response.","Electronic music artists and sound designers have unique workflow practices that necessitate specialized approaches for developing music information retrieval and creativity support tools.

Towards Correlated Sequential Rules,"The goal of high-utility sequential pattern mining (HUSPM) is to efficiently discover profitable or useful sequential patterns in a large number of sequences. However, simply being aware of utility-eligible patterns is insufficient for making predictions. To compensate for this deficiency, high-utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) is designed to explore the confidence or probability of predicting the occurrence of consequence sequential patterns based on the appearance of premise sequential patterns. It has numerous applications, such as product recommendation and weather prediction. However, the existing algorithm, known as HUSRM, is limited to extracting all eligible rules while neglecting the correlation between the generated sequential rules. To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm called correlated high-utility sequential rule miner (CoUSR) to integrate the concept of correlation into HUSRM. The proposed algorithm requires not only that each rule be correlated but also that the patterns in the antecedent and consequent of the high-utility sequential rule be correlated. The algorithm adopts a utility-list structure to avoid multiple database scans. Additionally, several pruning strategies are used to improve the algorithm's efficiency and performance. Based on several real-world datasets, subsequent experiments demonstrated that CoUSR is effective and efficient in terms of operation time and memory consumption.","The goal of high-utility sequential pattern mining (HUSPM) is to efficiently discover profitable or useful sequential patterns in a large number of sequences.However, simply being aware of utility-eligible patterns is insufficient for making predictions.To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm called correlated high-utility sequential rule miner (CoUSR) to integrate the concept of correlation into HUSRM."
Aerial Manipulation Using a Novel Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Cyber-Physical System,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAVs) are attaining more and more maneuverability and sensory ability as a promising teleoperation platform for intelligent interaction with the environments. This work presents a novel 5-degree-of-freedom (DoF) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cyber-physical system for aerial manipulation. This UAV's body is capable of exerting powerful propulsion force in the longitudinal direction, decoupling the translational dynamics and the rotational dynamics on the longitudinal plane. A high-level impedance control law is proposed to drive the vehicle for trajectory tracking and interaction with the environments. In addition, a vision-based real-time target identification and tracking method integrating a YOLO v3 real-time object detector with feature tracking, and morphological operations is proposed to be implemented onboard the vehicle with support of model compression techniques to eliminate latency caused by video wireless transmission and heavy computation burden on traditional teleoperation platforms.",Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAVs) are attaining more and more maneuverability and sensory ability as a promising teleoperation platform for intelligent interaction with the environments.
Exploring Effective Distillation of Self-Supervised Speech Models for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Recent years have witnessed great strides in self-supervised learning (SSL) on the speech processing. The SSL model is normally pre-trained on a great variety of unlabelled data and a large model size is preferred to increase the modeling capacity. However, this might limit its potential applications due to the expensive computation and memory costs introduced by the oversize model. Miniaturization for SSL models has become an important research direction of practical value. To this end, we explore the effective distillation of HuBERT-based SSL models for automatic speech recognition (ASR). First, in order to establish a strong baseline, a comprehensive study on different student model structures is conducted. On top of this, as a supplement to the regression loss widely adopted in previous works, a discriminative loss is introduced for HuBERT to enhance the distillation performance, especially in low-resource scenarios. In addition, we design a simple and effective algorithm to distill the front-end input from waveform to Fbank feature, resulting in 17% parameter reduction and doubling inference speed, at marginal performance degradation.",Recent years have witnessed great strides in self-supervised learning (SSL) on the speech processing.
Provably Doubly Accelerated Federated Learning: The First Theoretically Successful Combination of Local Training and Compressed Communication,"In the modern paradigm of federated learning, a large number of users are involved in a global learning task, in a collaborative way. They alternate local computations and two-way communication with a distant orchestrating server. Communication, which can be slow and costly, is the main bottleneck in this setting. To reduce the communication load and therefore accelerate distributed gradient descent, two strategies are popular: 1) communicate less frequently; that is, perform several iterations of local computations between the communication rounds; and 2) communicate compressed information instead of full-dimensional vectors. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm for distributed optimization and federated learning, which harnesses these two strategies jointly and converges linearly to an exact solution, with a doubly accelerated rate: our algorithm benefits from the two acceleration mechanisms provided by local training and compression, namely a better dependency on the condition number of the functions and on the dimension of the model, respectively.","In the modern paradigm of federated learning, a large number of users are involved in a global learning task, in a collaborative way.

Software-hardware Integration and Human-centered Benchmarking for Socially-compliant Robot Navigation,"The social compatibility (SC) is one of the most important parameters for service robots. It characterises the interaction quality between a robot and a human. In this paper, we first introduce an open-source software-hardware integration scheme for socially-compliant robot navigation and then propose a human-centered benchmarking framework. For the former, we integrate one 3D lidar, one 2D lidar, and four RGB-D cameras for robot exterior perception. The software system is entirely based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) with high modularity and fully deployed to the embedded hardware-based edge while running at a rate that exceeds the release frequency of sensor data. For the latter, we propose a new human-centered performance evaluation metric that can be used to measure SC quickly and efficiently. The values of this metric correlate with the results of the Godspeed questionnaire, which is believed to be a golden standard approach for SC measurements. Together with other commonly used metrics, we benchmark two open-source socially-compliant robot navigation methods, in an end-to-end manner. We clarify all aspects of the benchmarking to ensure the reproducibility of the experiments. We also show that the proposed new metric can provide further justification for the selection of numerical metrics (objective) from a human perspective (subjective).","The social compatibility (SC) is one of the most important parameters for service robots.

Neural Networks with Quantization Constraints,"Enabling low precision implementations of deep learning models, without considerable performance degradation, is necessary in resource and latency constrained settings. Moreover, exploiting the differences in sensitivity to quantization across layers can allow mixed precision implementations to achieve a considerably better computation performance trade-off. However, backpropagating through the quantization operation requires introducing gradient approximations, and choosing which layers to quantize is challenging for modern architectures due to the large search space. In this work, we present a constrained learning approach to quantization aware training. We formulate low precision supervised learning as a constrained optimization problem, and show that despite its non-convexity, the resulting problem is strongly dual and does away with gradient estimations. Furthermore, we show that dual variables indicate the sensitivity of the objective with respect to constraint perturbations. We demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits competitive performance in image classification tasks, and leverage the sensitivity result to apply layer selective quantization based on the value of dual variables, leading to considerable performance improvements.","Enabling low precision implementations of deep learning models, without considerable performance degradation, is necessary in resource and latency constrained settings.

Class Based Thresholding in Early Exit Semantic Segmentation Networks,"We propose Class Based Thresholding (CBT) to reduce the computational cost of early exit semantic segmentation models while preserving the mean intersection over union (mIoU) performance. A key idea of CBT is to exploit the naturally-occurring neural collapse phenomenon. Specifically, by calculating the mean prediction probabilities of each class in the training set, CBT assigns different masking threshold values to each class, so that the computation can be terminated sooner for pixels belonging to easy-to-predict classes. We show the effectiveness of CBT on Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets. CBT can reduce the computational cost by $23\%$ compared to the previous state-of-the-art early exit models.",We propose Class Based Thresholding (CBT) to reduce the computational cost of early exit semantic segmentation models while preserving the mean intersection over union (mIoU) performance.We show the effectiveness of CBT on Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets
Face-to-Face Contrastive Learning for Social Intelligence Question-Answering,"Creating artificial social intelligence - algorithms that can understand the nuances of multi-person interactions - is an exciting and emerging challenge in processing facial expressions and gestures from multimodal videos. Recent multimodal methods have set the state of the art on many tasks, but have difficulty modeling the complex face-to-face conversational dynamics across speaking turns in social interaction, particularly in a self-supervised setup. In this paper, we propose Face-to-Face Contrastive Learning (F2F-CL), a graph neural network designed to model social interactions using factorization nodes to contextualize the multimodal face-to-face interaction along the boundaries of the speaking turn. With the F2F-CL model, we propose to perform contrastive learning between the factorization nodes of different speaking turns within the same video. We experimentally evaluated the challenging Social-IQ dataset and show state-of-the-art results."," In this paper, we propose Face-to-Face Contrastive Learning (F2F-CL), a graph neural network designed to model social interactions using factorization nodes to contextualize the multimodal face-to-face interaction along the boundaries of the speaking turn."
Schema-aware Reference as Prompt Improves Data-Efficient Relational Triple and Event Extraction,"Information Extraction, which aims to extract structural relational triple or event from unstructured texts, often suffers from data scarcity issues. With the development of pre-trained language models, many prompt-based approaches to data-efficient information extraction have been proposed and achieved impressive performance. However, existing prompt learning methods for information extraction are still susceptible to several potential limitations: (i) semantic gap between natural language and output structure knowledge with pre-defined schema; (ii) representation learning with locally individual instances limits the performance given the insufficient features. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of schema-aware Reference As Prompt (RAP), which dynamically leverage schema and knowledge inherited from global (few-shot) training data for each sample. Specifically, we propose a schema-aware reference store, which unifies symbolic schema and relevant textual instances. Then, we employ a dynamic reference integration module to retrieve pertinent knowledge from the datastore as prompts during training and inference. Experimental results demonstrate that RAP can be plugged into various existing models and outperforms baselines in low-resource settings on four datasets of relational triple extraction and event extraction. In addition, we provide comprehensive empirical ablations and case analysis regarding different types and scales of knowledge in order to better understand the mechanisms of RAP. Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/RAP.","With the development of pre-trained language models, many prompt-based approaches to data-efficient information extraction have been proposed and achieved impressive performance.In this paper, we propose a novel approach of schema-aware Reference As Prompt (RAP), which dynamically leverage schema and knowledge inherited from global (few-shot) training data for each sample.

Efficient Phi-Regret Minimization in Extensive-Form Games via Online Mirror Descent,"A conceptually appealing approach for learning Extensive-Form Games (EFGs) is to convert them to Normal-Form Games (NFGs). This approach enables us to directly translate state-of-the-art techniques and analyses in NFGs to learning EFGs, but typically suffers from computational intractability due to the exponential blow-up of the game size introduced by the conversion. In this paper, we address this problem in natural and important setups for the \emph{$\Phi$-Hedge} algorithm -- A generic algorithm capable of learning a large class of equilibria for NFGs. We show that $\Phi$-Hedge can be directly used to learn Nash Equilibria (zero-sum settings), Normal-Form Coarse Correlated Equilibria (NFCCE), and Extensive-Form Correlated Equilibria (EFCE) in EFGs. We prove that, in those settings, the \emph{$\Phi$-Hedge} algorithms are equivalent to standard Online Mirror Descent (OMD) algorithms for EFGs with suitable dilated regularizers, and run in polynomial time. This new connection further allows us to design and analyze a new class of OMD algorithms based on modifying its log-partition function. In particular, we design an improved algorithm with balancing techniques that achieves a sharp $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{XAT})$ EFCE-regret under bandit-feedback in an EFG with $X$ information sets, $A$ actions, and $T$ episodes. To our best knowledge, this is the first such rate and matches the information-theoretic lower bound.","learning Extensive-Form Games (EFGs) is to convert them to Normal-Form Games (NFGs) enables us to directly translate state-of-the-art techniques and analyses in NFGs to learning EFGs, but typically suffers from computational intractability due to the exponential blow-up of the game size introduced by the conversion.In this paper, we address this problem in natural and important setups a generic algorithm capable of learning a large class of equilibria for NFGs.

Self-Supervised Speech Representation Learning: A Review,"Although supervised deep learning has revolutionized speech and audio processing, it has necessitated the building of specialist models for individual tasks and application scenarios. It is likewise difficult to apply this to dialects and languages for which only limited labeled data is available. Self-supervised representation learning methods promise a single universal model that would benefit a wide variety of tasks and domains. Such methods have shown success in natural language processing and computer vision domains, achieving new levels of performance while reducing the number of labels required for many downstream scenarios. Speech representation learning is experiencing similar progress in three main categories: generative, contrastive, and predictive methods. Other approaches rely on multi-modal data for pre-training, mixing text or visual data streams with speech. Although self-supervised speech representation is still a nascent research area, it is closely related to acoustic word embedding and learning with zero lexical resources, both of which have seen active research for many years. This review presents approaches for self-supervised speech representation learning and their connection to other research areas.

Neural Parameterization for Dynamic Human Head Editing,"Implicit radiance functions emerged as a powerful scene representation for reconstructing and rendering photo-realistic views of a 3D scene. These representations, however, suffer from poor editability. On the other hand, explicit representations such as polygonal meshes allow easy editing but are not as suitable for reconstructing accurate details in dynamic human heads, such as fine facial features, hair, teeth, and eyes. In this work, we present Neural Parameterization (NeP), a hybrid representation that provides the advantages of both implicit and explicit methods. NeP is capable of photo-realistic rendering while allowing fine-grained editing of the scene geometry and appearance. We first disentangle the geometry and appearance by parameterizing the 3D geometry into 2D texture space. We enable geometric editability by introducing an explicit linear deformation blending layer. The deformation is controlled by a set of sparse key points, which can be explicitly and intuitively displaced to edit the geometry. For appearance, we develop a hybrid 2D texture consisting of an explicit texture map for easy editing and implicit view and time-dependent residuals to model temporal and view variations. We compare our method to several reconstruction and editing baselines. The results show that the NeP achieves almost the same level of rendering accuracy while maintaining high editability.","Implicit radiance functions emerged as a powerful scene representation for reconstructing and rendering photo-realistic views of a 3D scene.

ACES: Translation Accuracy Challenge Sets for Evaluating Machine Translation Metrics,"As machine translation (MT) metrics improve their correlation with human judgement every year, it is crucial to understand the limitations of such metrics at the segment level. Specifically, it is important to investigate metric behaviour when facing accuracy errors in MT because these can have dangerous consequences in certain contexts (e.g., legal, medical). We curate ACES, a translation accuracy challenge set, consisting of 68 phenomena ranging from simple perturbations at the word/character level to more complex errors based on discourse and real-world knowledge. We use ACES to evaluate a wide range of MT metrics including the submissions to the WMT 2022 metrics shared task and perform several analyses leading to general recommendations for metric developers. We recommend: a) combining metrics with different strengths, b) developing metrics that give more weight to the source and less to surface-level overlap with the reference and c) explicitly modelling additional language-specific information beyond what is available via multilingual embeddings.","As machine translation (MT) metrics improve their correlation with human judgement every year, it is crucial to understand the limitations of such metrics at the segment level.

Private and Reliable Neural Network Inference,"Reliable neural networks (NNs) provide important inference-time reliability guarantees such as fairness and robustness. Complementarily, privacy-preserving NN inference protects the privacy of client data. So far these two emerging areas have been largely disconnected, yet their combination will be increasingly important. In this work, we present the first system which enables privacy-preserving inference on reliable NNs. Our key idea is to design efficient fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) counterparts for the core algorithmic building blocks of randomized smoothing, a state-of-the-art technique for obtaining reliable models. The lack of required control flow in FHE makes this a demanding task, as na\""ive solutions lead to unacceptable runtime. We employ these building blocks to enable privacy-preserving NN inference with robustness and fairness guarantees in a system called Phoenix. Experimentally, we demonstrate that Phoenix achieves its goals without incurring prohibitive latencies. To our knowledge, this is the first work which bridges the areas of client data privacy and reliability guarantees for NNs.","Reliable neural networks (NNs) provide important inference-time reliability guarantees such as fairness and robustness.In this work, we present the first system which enables privacy-preserving inference on reliable NNs.

"Unified Algorithms for RL with Decision-Estimation Coefficients: No-Regret, PAC, and Reward-Free Learning","Finding unified complexity measures and algorithms for sample-efficient learning is a central topic of research in reinforcement learning (RL). The Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC) is recently proposed by Foster et al. (2021) as a necessary and sufficient complexity measure for sample-efficient no-regret RL. This paper makes progress towards a unified theory for RL with the DEC framework. First, we propose two new DEC-type complexity measures: Explorative DEC (EDEC), and Reward-Free DEC (RFDEC). We show that they are necessary and sufficient for sample-efficient PAC learning and reward-free learning, thereby extending the original DEC which only captures no-regret learning. Next, we design new unified sample-efficient algorithms for all three learning goals. Our algorithms instantiate variants of the Estimation-To-Decisions (E2D) meta-algorithm with a strong and general model estimation subroutine. Even in the no-regret setting, our algorithm E2D-TA improves upon the algorithms of Foster et al. (2021) which require either bounding a variant of the DEC which may be prohibitively large, or designing problem-specific estimation subroutines. As applications, we recover existing and obtain new sample-efficient learning results for a wide range of tractable RL problems using essentially a single algorithm. We also generalize the DEC to give sample-efficient algorithms for all-policy model estimation, with applications for learning equilibria in Markov Games. Finally, as a connection, we re-analyze two existing optimistic model-based algorithms based on Posterior Sampling or Maximum Likelihood Estimation, showing that they enjoy similar regret bounds as E2D-TA under similar structural conditions as the DEC.","Finding unified complexity measures and algorithms for sample-efficient learning is a central topic of research in reinforcement learning (RL).This paper makes progress towards a unified theory for RL with the DEC framework.

Working Alliance Transformer for Psychotherapy Dialogue Classification,"As a predictive measure of the treatment outcome in psychotherapy, the working alliance measures the agreement of the patient and the therapist in terms of their bond, task and goal. Long been a clinical quantity estimated by the patients' and therapists' self-evaluative reports, we believe that the working alliance can be better characterized using natural language processing technique directly in the dialogue transcribed in each therapy session. In this work, we propose the Working Alliance Transformer (WAT), a Transformer-based classification model that has a psychological state encoder which infers the working alliance scores by projecting the embedding of the dialogues turns onto the embedding space of the clinical inventory for working alliance. We evaluate our method in a real-world dataset with over 950 therapy sessions with anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and suicidal patients and demonstrate an empirical advantage of using information about the therapeutic states in this sequence classification task of psychotherapy dialogues.","we believe that the working alliance can be better characterized using natural language processing technique directly in the dialogue transcribed in each therapy session.

CrAM: A Compression-Aware Minimizer,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) often have to be compressed, via pruning and/or quantization, before they can be deployed in practical settings. In this work we propose a new compression-aware minimizer dubbed CrAM that modifies the optimization step in a principled way, in order to produce models whose local loss behavior is stable under compression operations such as pruning. Thus, dense models trained via CrAM should be compressible post-training, in a single step, without significant accuracy loss. Experimental results on standard benchmarks, such as residual networks for ImageNet classification and BERT models for language modelling, show that CrAM produces dense models that can be more accurate than the standard SGD/Adam-based baselines, but which are stable under weight pruning: specifically, we can prune models in one-shot to 70-80% sparsity with reasonable ($\leq 1\%$) accuracy loss, which is competitive with gradual compression methods. Additionally, we show that CrAM produces sparse models which perform well for transfer learning, and that it also works for semi-structured pruning patterns supported by GPU hardware.","Deep neural networks (DNNs) often have to be compressed, via pruning and/or quantization, before they can be deployed in practical settings.In this work we propose a new compression-aware minimizer dubbed CrAM that modifies the optimization step in a principled way, in order to produce models whose local loss behavior is stable under compression operations such as pruning."
Provable Sim-to-real Transfer in Continuous Domain with Partial Observations,"Sim-to-real transfer trains RL agents in the simulated environments and then deploys them in the real world. Sim-to-real transfer has been widely used in practice because it is often cheaper, safer and much faster to collect samples in simulation than in the real world. Despite the empirical success of the sim-to-real transfer, its theoretical foundation is much less understood. In this paper, we study the sim-to-real transfer in continuous domain with partial observations, where the simulated environments and real-world environments are modeled by linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems. We show that a popular robust adversarial training algorithm is capable of learning a policy from the simulated environment that is competitive to the optimal policy in the real-world environment. To achieve our results, we design a new algorithm for infinite-horizon average-cost LQGs and establish a regret bound that depends on the intrinsic complexity of the model class. Our algorithm crucially relies on a novel history clipping scheme, which might be of independent interest.","Sim-to-real transfer trains RL agents in the simulated environments and then deploys them in the real world.In this paper, we study the sim-to-real transfer in continuous domain with partial observations, where the simulated environments and real-world environments are modeled by linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems.

TreeSketchNet: From Sketch To 3D Tree Parameters Generation,"3D modeling of non-linear objects from stylized sketches is a challenge even for experts in Computer Graphics (CG). The extrapolation of objects parameters from a stylized sketch is a very complex and cumbersome task. In the present study, we propose a broker system that mediates between the modeler and the 3D modelling software and can transform a stylized sketch of a tree into a complete 3D model. The input sketches do not need to be accurate or detailed, and only need to represent a rudimentary outline of the tree that the modeler wishes to 3D-model. Our approach is based on a well-defined Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture, we called TreeSketchNet (TSN), based on convolutions and able to generate Weber and Penn parameters that can be interpreted by the modelling software to generate a 3D model of a tree starting from a simple sketch. The training dataset consists of Synthetically-Generated \revision{(SG)} sketches that are associated with Weber-Penn parameters generated by a dedicated Blender modelling software add-on. The accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated by testing the TSN with both synthetic and hand-made sketches. Finally, we provide a qualitative analysis of our results, by evaluating the coherence of the predicted parameters with several distinguishing features.","3D modeling of non-linear objects from stylized sketches is a challenge even for experts in Computer Graphics (CG).

Fine-grained Noise Control for Multispeaker Speech Synthesis,"A text-to-speech (TTS) model typically factorizes speech attributes such as content, speaker and prosody into disentangled representations.Recent works aim to additionally model the acoustic conditions explicitly, in order to disentangle the primary speech factors, i.e. linguistic content, prosody and timbre from any residual factors, such as recording conditions and background noise.This paper proposes unsupervised, interpretable and fine-grained noise and prosody modeling. We incorporate adversarial training, representation bottleneck and utterance-to-frame modeling in order to learn frame-level noise representations. To the same end, we perform fine-grained prosody modeling via a Fully Hierarchical Variational AutoEncoder (FVAE) which additionally results in more expressive speech synthesis.","This paper proposes unsupervised, interpretable and fine-grained noise and prosody modeling for ext-to-speech (TTS) models."
Joint Multi-Person Body Detection and Orientation Estimation via One Unified Embedding,"Human body orientation estimation (HBOE) is widely applied into various applications, including robotics, surveillance, pedestrian analysis and autonomous driving. Although many approaches have been addressing the HBOE problem from specific under-controlled scenes to challenging in-the-wild environments, they assume human instances are already detected and take a well cropped sub-image as the input. This setting is less efficient and prone to errors in real application, such as crowds of people. In the paper, we propose a single-stage end-to-end trainable framework for tackling the HBOE problem with multi-persons. By integrating the prediction of bounding boxes and direction angles in one embedding, our method can jointly estimate the location and orientation of all bodies in one image directly. Our key idea is to integrate the HBOE task into the multi-scale anchor channel predictions of persons for concurrently benefiting from engaged intermediate features. Therefore, our approach can naturally adapt to difficult instances involving low resolution and occlusion as in object detection. We validated the efficiency and effectiveness of our method in the recently presented benchmark MEBOW with extensive experiments. Besides, we completed ambiguous instances ignored by the MEBOW dataset, and provided corresponding weak body-orientation labels to keep the integrity and consistency of it for supporting studies toward multi-persons. Our work is available at \url{https://github.com/hnuzhy/JointBDOE}.","Human body orientation estimation (HBOE) is widely applied into various applications.In the paper, we propose a single-stage end-to-end trainable framework for tackling the HBOE problem with multi-persons.

First is Better Than Last for Language Data Influence,"The ability to identify influential training examples enables us to debug training data and explain model behavior. Existing techniques to do so are based on the flow of training data influence through the model parameters. For large models in NLP applications, it is often computationally infeasible to study this flow through all model parameters, therefore techniques usually pick the last layer of weights. However, we observe that since the activation connected to the last layer of weights contains ""shared logic"", the data influenced calculated via the last layer weights prone to a ``cancellation effect'', where the data influence of different examples have large magnitude that contradicts each other. The cancellation effect lowers the discriminative power of the influence score, and deleting influential examples according to this measure often does not change the model's behavior by much. To mitigate this, we propose a technique called TracIn-WE that modifies a method called TracIn to operate on the word embedding layer instead of the last layer, where the cancellation effect is less severe. One potential concern is that influence based on the word embedding layer may not encode sufficient high level information. However, we find that gradients (unlike embeddings) do not suffer from this, possibly because they chain through higher layers. We show that TracIn-WE significantly outperforms other data influence methods applied on the last layer significantly on the case deletion evaluation on three language classification tasks for different models. In addition, TracIn-WE can produce scores not just at the level of the overall training input, but also at the level of words within the training input, a further aid in debugging.","The ability to identify influential training examples enables us to debug training data and explain model behavior.

Just Fine-tune Twice: Selective Differential Privacy for Large Language Models,"Protecting large language models from privacy leakage is becoming increasingly crucial with their wide adoption in real-world products. Yet applying differential privacy (DP), a canonical notion with provable privacy guarantees for machine learning models, to those models remains challenging due to the trade-off between model utility and privacy loss. Utilizing the fact that sensitive information in language data tends to be sparse, Shi et al. (2021) formalized a DP notion extension called Selective Differential Privacy (SDP) to protect only the sensitive tokens defined by a policy function. However, their algorithm only works for RNN-based models. In this paper, we develop a novel framework, Just Fine-tune Twice (JFT), that achieves SDP for state-of-the-art large transformer-based models. Our method is easy to implement: it first fine-tunes the model with redacted in-domain data, and then fine-tunes it again with the original in-domain data using a private training mechanism. Furthermore, we study the scenario of imperfect implementation of policy functions that misses sensitive tokens and develop systematic methods to handle it. Experiments show that our method achieves strong utility compared to previous baselines. We also analyze the SDP privacy guarantee empirically with the canary insertion attack.","Protecting large language models from privacy leakage is becoming increasingly crucial with their wide adoption in real-world products.

GammaE: Gamma Embeddings for Logical Queries on Knowledge Graphs,"Embedding knowledge graphs (KGs) for multi-hop logical reasoning is a challenging problem due to massive and complicated structures in many KGs. Recently, many promising works projected entities and queries into a geometric space to efficiently find answers. However, it remains challenging to model the negation and union operator. The negation operator has no strict boundaries, which generates overlapped embeddings and leads to obtaining ambiguous answers. An additional limitation is that the union operator is non-closure, which undermines the model to handle a series of union operators. To address these problems, we propose a novel probabilistic embedding model, namely Gamma Embeddings (GammaE), for encoding entities and queries to answer different types of FOL queries on KGs. We utilize the linear property and strong boundary support of the Gamma distribution to capture more features of entities and queries, which dramatically reduces model uncertainty. Furthermore, GammaE implements the Gamma mixture method to design the closed union operator. The performance of GammaE is validated on three large logical query datasets. Experimental results show that GammaE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on public benchmarks.","Embedding knowledge graphs (KGs) for multi-hop logical reasoning is a challenging problem due to massive and complicated structures in many KGs.To address these problems, we propose a novel probabilistic embedding model, namely Gamma Embeddings (GammaE), for encoding entities and queries to answer different types of FOL queries on KGs.

A Graph Is More Than Its Nodes: Towards Structured Uncertainty-Aware Learning on Graphs,"Current graph neural networks (GNNs) that tackle node classification on graphs tend to only focus on nodewise scores and are solely evaluated by nodewise metrics. This limits uncertainty estimation on graphs since nodewise marginals do not fully characterize the joint distribution given the graph structure. In this work, we propose novel edgewise metrics, namely the edgewise expected calibration error (ECE) and the agree/disagree ECEs, which provide criteria for uncertainty estimation on graphs beyond the nodewise setting. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed edgewise metrics can complement the nodewise results and yield additional insights. Moreover, we show that GNN models which consider the structured prediction problem on graphs tend to have better uncertainty estimations, which illustrates the benefit of going beyond the nodewise setting.","In this work, we propose novel edgewise metrics, namely the edgewise expected calibration error (ECE) and the agree/disagree ECEs, which provide criteria for uncertainty estimation on graphs beyond the nodewise setting."
Multi-task Bias-Variance Trade-off Through Functional Constraints,"Multi-task learning aims to acquire a set of functions, either regressors or classifiers, that perform well for diverse tasks. At its core, the idea behind multi-task learning is to exploit the intrinsic similarity across data sources to aid in the learning process for each individual domain. In this paper we draw intuition from the two extreme learning scenarios -- a single function for all tasks, and a task-specific function that ignores the other tasks dependencies -- to propose a bias-variance trade-off. To control the relationship between the variance (given by the number of i.i.d. samples), and the bias (coming from data from other task), we introduce a constrained learning formulation that enforces domain specific solutions to be close to a central function. This problem is solved in the dual domain, for which we propose a stochastic primal-dual algorithm. Experimental results for a multi-domain classification problem with real data show that the proposed procedure outperforms both the task specific, as well as the single classifiers.","Multi-task learning aims to acquire a set of functions, either regressors or classifiers, that perform well for diverse tasks.

Full-scale Deeply Supervised Attention Network for Segmenting COVID-19 Lesions,"Automated delineation of COVID-19 lesions from lung CT scans aids the diagnosis and prognosis for patients. The asymmetric shapes and positioning of the infected regions make the task extremely difficult. Capturing information at multiple scales will assist in deciphering features, at global and local levels, to encompass lesions of variable size and texture. We introduce the Full-scale Deeply Supervised Attention Network (FuDSA-Net), for efficient segmentation of corona-infected lung areas in CT images. The model considers activation responses from all levels of the encoding path, encompassing multi-scalar features acquired at different levels of the network. This helps segment target regions (lesions) of varying shape, size and contrast. Incorporation of the entire gamut of multi-scalar characteristics into the novel attention mechanism helps prioritize the selection of activation responses and locations containing useful information. Determining robust and discriminatory features along the decoder path is facilitated with deep supervision. Connections in the decoder arm are remodeled to handle the issue of vanishing gradient. As observed from the experimental results, FuDSA-Net surpasses other state-of-the-art architectures; especially, when it comes to characterizing complicated geometries of the lesions.","Automated delineation of COVID-19 lesions from lung CT scans aids the diagnosis and prognosis for patients.We introduce the Full-scale Deeply Supervised Attention Network (FuDSA-Net), for efficient segmentation of corona-infected lung areas in CT images.

Efficient few-shot learning for pixel-precise handwritten document layout analysis,"Layout analysis is a task of uttermost importance in ancient handwritten document analysis and represents a fundamental step toward the simplification of subsequent tasks such as optical character recognition and automatic transcription. However, many of the approaches adopted to solve this problem rely on a fully supervised learning paradigm. While these systems achieve very good performance on this task, the drawback is that pixel-precise text labeling of the entire training set is a very time-consuming process, which makes this type of information rarely available in a real-world scenario. In the present paper, we address this problem by proposing an efficient few-shot learning framework that achieves performances comparable to current state-of-the-art fully supervised methods on the publicly available DIVA-HisDB dataset.","In the present paper, we are proposing an efficient few-shot learning framework that achieves performances comparable to current state-of-the-art fully supervised methods on the publicly available DIVA-HisDB dataset."
Training Graph Neural Networks on Growing Stochastic Graphs,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) rely on graph convolutions to exploit meaningful patterns in networked data. Based on matrix multiplications, convolutions incur in high computational costs leading to scalability limitations in practice. To overcome these limitations, proposed methods rely on training GNNs in smaller number of nodes, and then transferring the GNN to larger graphs. Even though these methods are able to bound the difference between the output of the GNN with different number of nodes, they do not provide guarantees against the optimal GNN on the very large graph. In this paper, we propose to learn GNNs on very large graphs by leveraging the limit object of a sequence of growing graphs, the graphon. We propose to grow the size of the graph as we train, and we show that our proposed methodology -- learning by transference -- converges to a neighborhood of a first order stationary point on the graphon data. A numerical experiment validates our proposed approach.","To overcome the high computation costs for training the graph neural network, proposed methods rely on training GNNs in smaller number of nodes, and then transferring the GNN to larger graphs.

UNet-2022: Exploring Dynamics in Non-isomorphic Architecture,"Recent medical image segmentation models are mostly hybrid, which integrate self-attention and convolution layers into the non-isomorphic architecture. However, one potential drawback of these approaches is that they failed to provide an intuitive explanation of why this hybrid combination manner is beneficial, making it difficult for subsequent work to make improvements on top of them. To address this issue, we first analyze the differences between the weight allocation mechanisms of the self-attention and convolution. Based on this analysis, we propose to construct a parallel non-isomorphic block that takes the advantages of self-attention and convolution with simple parallelization. We name the resulting U-shape segmentation model as UNet-2022. In experiments, UNet-2022 obviously outperforms its counterparts in a range segmentation tasks, including abdominal multi-organ segmentation, automatic cardiac diagnosis, neural structures segmentation, and skin lesion segmentation, sometimes surpassing the best performing baseline by 4%. Specifically, UNet-2022 surpasses nnUNet, the most recognized segmentation model at present, by large margins. These phenomena indicate the potential of UNet-2022 to become the model of choice for medical image segmentation.","Recent medical image segmentation models are mostly hybrid, which integrate self-attention and convolution layers into the non-isomorphic architecture.
